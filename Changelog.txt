Added runtime for each movie to show on cover.
Added icon in tab.Reel icon referenced by film.png in head tag of html document.

The Days Panel is now fully functional. In the Coming Soon Tab, you can only see the poster, cannot click on it.
New font style and accent color. (To better fit the whole UI)

Added forms for user to register/log in with validation capabilities.
User cannot access My Account panel unless s/he is logged in.
User can now log out from My Account and the session is destroyed.
Live check for username and email and disables register button
User cannot access index.php unless s/he is logged in
When user checks out, it creates a log of movie bookings which can be accessed from My Account => Bookings

Booking of seats are now made permanent! Can also book same movies on different days, each having its own set of bookings.
Implemented the Search functionality. Filter movies by their exact name, not partial!
*The Search box is only toggled when viewing on Categories section: to avoid conflict with Days Panel. That is why, click function is disabled.

Users can now send the support team an email and the script will send an automatic "no-reply" to the user confirming that the email was received.
Users can now change their usernames from the "Account" panel!
SQL statements were converted to prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection where appropriate.(see check_register and check_login)
Admin panel has been designed using BOOTSTRAP. The admin panel has in-site navigation capabilities with functionalities like "Viewing Bookings","Resetting Movie Seats", and "Deleting Users". Other related updation/deletion are also made based on the operation selected to keep the system in a consistent state. For example, deleting a user will also delete bookings made by that user.

Designed a basic homepage(welcome.html) to give overview of business and provides a button which links to Register/Log in system. 
The 'selected' class will only be toggled when viewing EITHER on Days Panel OR Categories Panel, not both.
The categories section is now made to be viewed only. That is, you can only book movies through the Days Panel.
When a cover is clicked and data is displayed, the Days menu is temporarily disabled from any click activity. That is, to re-navigate, you have to click on "Arrow Back Icon". This is to avoid mixing up variables value(ie Day) when booking.
*Live authentication of Username and Password upon Login. Disables Login button if any field contains incorrect data.
